Abstract class and Abstract Method:
"Abstract Method" – A method without a body.

"Abstract Class" – A class containing abstract members.

Summary

The video by Bangar Raju from Narish Technologies provides a detailed explanation of how to use abstract classes and abstract methods in object-oriented programming, specifically within application development. Building upon a previous introductory video, this tutorial focuses on practical implementation. The example centers around geometric shapes—rectangle, circle, triangle, and cone—to demonstrate inheritance and abstraction concepts. The video emphasizes identifying common attributes among these entities, consolidating those attributes in a parent abstract class called Figure, and then extending this class with concrete child classes representing each shape. A key point is the use of an abstract method getArea(), declared in the parent class but implemented uniquely in each child class due to differing formulas for computing area. This ensures consistency in method signature across different subclasses while allowing varied implementations. Additionally, the tutorial highlights advantages of this approach, such as reducing code duplication, facilitating reusability, and enforcing uniformity when multiple developers work on different subclasses.

Highlights
🧩 Abstract classes contain abstract methods that have no method body and must be implemented by subclasses.
📐 Common attributes of geometric shapes like width, height, radius, and Pi are encapsulated in an abstract parent class Figure.
🔄 Inheritance enables child classes (Rectangle, Circle, Cone, Triangle) to reuse attributes from the parent class, promoting code reusability.
⚙️ The abstract method getArea() is declared in the parent class but implemented differently in each subclass, reflecting shape-specific area computation.
🤝 Abstract methods enforce all subclasses to implement certain functionalities with consistent method naming and signatures.
👥 Using abstract classes and methods helps standardize code when multiple developers work on different subclasses, preventing inconsistencies.
💡 Abstract classes enable better scalability—new shapes can be added easily by extending the parent class and implementing required abstract methods.
Key Insights
🧱 Foundation of Abstraction and Inheritance: The video effectively illustrates how abstract classes serve as blueprints encapsulating common attributes and behavior signatures for a family of related classes. This foundation helps in organizing code hierarchically and logically, enhancing maintainability.
♻️ Code Reusability through Common Attributes: By extracting common properties such as width, height, radius, and pi into the Figure parent class, the need to repeatedly declare these in every shape class is eliminated. This decreases redundancy and errors related to inconsistent attribute definitions.
🛠️ Abstract Methods Define a Contract: Declaring getArea() as an abstract method in the parent class enforces child classes to provide their own specific implementations. This contract ensures that every subclass supports the area calculation functionality, even though each formula differs.
🔄 Uniform Method Signatures Across Subclasses: A major advantage of abstract methods is maintaining consistent method names and signatures across all subclasses. This consistency simplifies usage and understanding of the code, especially useful in team environments where multiple programmers implement different shape classes.
🔍 Flexibility and Scalability in Application Design: The approach shown allows easily adding new shapes (e.g., polygons, hexagons) by extending the Figure class and implementing getArea(). The overall system can evolve without major restructuring.
⚠️ Why Abstract Instead of Concrete Methods: The video clarifies that when a behavior (like calculating area) varies significantly per subclass, defining it concretely in the parent doesn’t make sense. Instead, declaring it abstract forces subclasses to provide the specific implementation.
🧑‍💻 Improved Collaboration in Development Teams: Using abstract classes and methods encourages uniformity and reduces conflicts caused by inconsistent naming conventions or method signatures when different developers work on different components. This design pattern thus aids in smoother development and future code maintenance.

This comprehensive explanation not only covers the theoretical significance of abstract classes and methods but also practically demonstrates their application in a real-world scenario, making it a valuable instructional resource for developers aiming to implement object-oriented principles effectively.
